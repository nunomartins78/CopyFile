The wind blew fiercely through the streets, sending leaves and debris flying in every direction.
The sky was a deep shade of grey, and it seemed as though a storm was brewing.
Despite the inclement weather, a small group of people huddled together under a bus shelter, laughing and chatting
as if they didn't have a care in the world.
In the distance, the sound of thunder could be heard, but it didn't dampen their spirits.
They were determined to enjoy the moment, no matter what Mother Nature had in store for them.
