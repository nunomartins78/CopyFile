The sun was setting over the mountains, casting a warm golden glow over the landscape.
The birds sang sweetly in the trees, and the gentle breeze carried the scent of wildflowers.
The small stream that flowed through the meadow sparkled in the light, and the tall grass swayed softly.
It was the perfect evening for a peaceful stroll.
